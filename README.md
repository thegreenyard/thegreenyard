# Welcome to The Green Yard!

Hello and welcome to The Green Yard! My name is Schuyler, and I'm excited to share my journey with you. My wife and I just moved into a new house in the heart of Phoenix, and we're on a mission to transform our brown, slightly landscaped, and mostly unusable yard into a beautiful, green, profitable, and livable landscape.

## About Me

I'm passionate about sustainability, gardening, and creating beautiful outdoor spaces. Join me as I document the process of turning our yard into a thriving oasis. From planning and planting to maintenance and harvesting, I'll share tips, tricks, and insights every step of the way.
